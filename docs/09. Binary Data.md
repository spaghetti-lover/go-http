# Binary Data

- Yes, HTTP can send binary data
- Implement: check commit
- Test:

```bash
# Create a video in asset folder. For example:
mkdir assets
curl -o assets/vim.mp4 https://storage.googleapis.com/qvault-webapp-dynamic-assets/lesson_videos/vim-vs-neovim-prime.mp4

# Start your server
go run ./cmd/httpserver

# Test in browser - navigate to:
# http://localhost:42069/video

# Or test with curl
curl -v http://localhost:42069/video --output test.mp4

# Or use curl to see just headers
curl -I http://localhost:42069/video
```

## Some key difference between HTTP 1.1, HTTP 2 and HTTP 3

### HTTP/2

Some key difference include:

- It's a binary protocol rather than text-based. This makes it more efficient and less error-prone, but also requires more steps to debug, typically.
- HTTP/2 uses multiplexing, which allows multiple requests and responses to be sent over a single connection at the same time. This reduces latency and improves performance.
- Uses header compression to save on header bandwidth.
- Allows for server push, which lets the server send resources to the client before they are requested.

### HTTP/3

- Built on QUIC instead of TCP. QUIC is a transport layer protocol that runs over UDP, which allows for faster connection establishment and improved performance.

- Mandates encryption at the HTTP protocol level (HTTP/1.1 is unencrypted by default, meaning it requires HTTPS to be secure).
